# Welcome

This GitHub repo is dedicated to showcasing my work related to **Computer Science** and **Cybersecurity**. I have created this repo not only to display my achievements but also to provide walkthroughs for **HackTheBox** machines and challenges that others may find helpful. 

In the future, I plan to create a repository to share tools that I have personally developed, which have assisted me in various challenges. 

If you have any questions or comments, you are more than welcome to contact me.
